# Face-Generation

This is the fifth project in my Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation (Udacity). Using the template provided by Udacity, I added the necessary code to build a generative adversial network, with TensorFlow, that can create new faces based on the dataset of celebrity faces. The model was trained using FloydHub.

The easiest way to view my work is to look at the .ipynb file.

helper.py contains helper functions that were provided by Udacity.

problem_unittests.py contains tests to ensure that I am correctly building my model as I progress through the project; provided by Udacity.
